## What is the DMCA?

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a US law that provides a process for copyright holders to request removal of infringing content from online platforms.

**Common scenarios on webcam.org:**
- Camera incidentally captures copyrighted music playing outdoors
- Camera view includes TV screen showing copyrighted content
- User uploads a video clip containing copyrighted material

**Note:** Incidental, unintentional capture of copyrighted content in the background of a live camera stream is often considered fair use, but we will respond to valid DMCA notices.

## Repeat Infringer Policy

### Three Strikes

We take copyright infringement seriously and have a **repeat infringer policy**:

**First violation:**
- Content removed
- Warning issued
- Account remains active

**Second violation:**
- Content removed
- Account suspended for 30 days
- Public camera privileges revoked

**Third violation:**

- Mistakes (incomplete notices) don't count
- Successful counter-notices remove strikes

## Fair Use Considerations

### When DMCA May Not Apply

**Fair use** is a legal defense to copyright infringement. Factors include:
1. Purpose (commercial vs. educational)
2. Nature of copyrighted work
3. Amount used
4. Effect on market value

**Examples that may be fair use:**
- Incidental music playing in background of outdoor camera
- Brief snippets of copyrighted content in larger context
- Transformative use (commentary, criticism, parody)
- Non-commercial, informational sharing

**Note:** Fair use is complex. We are not judges and cannot make fair use determinations. If you believe your use is fair use, file a counter-notice.

## Special Situations

### Live Streams
Copyright claims on live camera streams are complicated:
- Content is constantly changing
- Infringement may be brief and unintentional
- Camera owner may not even be aware

**Our approach:**
- We'll notify camera owner immediately
- Camera owner can adjust angle or mute audio
- Persistent, intentional infringement = takedown

### Incidental Background Content
Cameras may incidentally capture:
- Music from passing cars
- TV through neighbor's window
- Radio from outdoor speaker

**This is often considered de minimis (too minor) or fair use.**

We assess each claim individually based on:
- Duration and prominence of copyrighted content
- Intent of camera owner
- Nature of the use

### Public Performances
Some copyrighted content in public spaces may be:
- Licensed for public performance
- Fair use due to transformative nature
- De minimis (too minor to infringe)

**Example:** Street musician performing copyrighted songs is likely licensed or fair use.

- Attorney's fees
- Court costs
