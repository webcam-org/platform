                <p>Whether you're working remotely, streaming, or staying connected with loved ones, having a quality webcam is essential. With so many options available, finding the right one can be overwhelming. We've tested dozens of webcams to bring you this comprehensive guide.</p>

                <h2>What to Look For in a Webcam</h2>
                <p>Before diving into specific models, here are the key features to consider:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p is the sweet spot for most users, though 4K is available for professionals</li>
                    <li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> 30fps is standard, but 60fps provides smoother motion</li>
                    <li><strong>Autofocus:</strong> Essential for maintaining sharp image quality as you move</li>
                    <li><strong>Low-light Performance:</strong> Important for rooms without perfect lighting</li>
                    <li><strong>Field of View:</strong> 78-90 degrees works well for solo use; wider angles for group calls</li>
