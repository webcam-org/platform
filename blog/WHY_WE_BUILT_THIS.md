## It’s Time to Take Back Control of Our Cameras

We’ve all seen the headlines. “Ring gave police warrantless access to user footage.” “Nest camera hacked, family terrorized.” “Security camera company employees spied on customers.”

For too long, we’ve been told that to have the convenience of home security, we have to accept a certain level of surveillance. We have to pay a monthly fee to a big corporation, store our most private moments on their servers, and trust that they won’t abuse that access.

We believe that’s a false choice.

We believe you can have both convenience and privacy. You can have a modern, easy-to-use security camera system without sacrificing your fundamental rights. You can own your hardware, own your data, and still get the features you need to protect your home and family.

That’s why we built webcam.org.

## What is webcam.org?

webcam.org is a free, open-source, privacy-first platform that gives you the tools to build your own home security system. It’s a Ring/Nest alternative for people who value their privacy.

Here’s how it works:

1.  **You bring the hardware.** Use any IP camera that supports the RTSP protocol, or a simple USB webcam. No proprietary hardware required.
2.  **You run the software.** Install our open-source software on a computer you own, like a Raspberry Pi or an old laptop.
3.  **You own the data.** Your video footage is stored on your own device, not on our servers. We can’t see it, and we can’t share it.

With webcam.org, you get the features you expect from a modern security system:

-   **Live view from anywhere** with our mobile app.
-   **Instant motion alerts** on your phone.
-   **AI-powered person detection** that runs locally on your device.
-   **24/7 recording** with no monthly fees.

## The Community Camera Network

But we’re not just building a security platform. We’re also building a community. If you have a camera pointed at a public space—a busy street, a beautiful view, a local surf spot—you can choose to share it on our public map. This creates a community-powered network of public webcams that anyone can browse.

It’s like a neighborhood watch for the digital age, but with privacy at its core.

## Why Open Source?

Trust is everything when it comes to security. That’s why we’ve made our code open source. Anyone can inspect our code on GitHub to verify that we’re living up to our privacy promises. There are no hidden backdoors, no secret data collection.

We’re building webcam.org in the open, with the community, for the community.

## The Future is Self-Hosted

We believe that the future of home security is self-hosted. It’s a future where you are in control, not a big corporation. A future where your privacy is a right, not a feature you have to pay for.

We’re just getting started, and we’d love for you to join us. Visit our website to learn more, check out our code on GitHub, and install the software to take the first step in taking back control of your cameras.

Your Cameras. Your Privacy. Your Community.
