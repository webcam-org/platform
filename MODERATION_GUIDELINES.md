**Author:** Gemini

This document outlines the guidelines and procedures for moderating the public webcam directory on webcam.org. Our goal is to maintain a safe, legal, and high-quality directory of public webcams while respecting the privacy of individuals.

## 📜 Guiding Principles

- **Privacy First:** Our primary concern is protecting the privacy of individuals. We will err on the side of caution when it comes to potentially invasive cameras.
- **Community Benefit:** Public cameras should provide a benefit to the community (e.g., traffic, weather, scenic views).
- **Transparency:** Our moderation rules and decisions should be clear and consistent.

## 📝 Review Process for New Cameras

All new public camera submissions will be manually reviewed by a moderator before they are approved and listed on the public directory.

**Review Checklist:**

1.  **Verify Public Space:** Does the camera point to a public space? (e.g., street, beach, park).
2.  **Check for Privacy Invasion:** Does the camera zoom in on private property, such as a house or apartment window?
3.  **No Sensitive Locations:** The camera should not be pointed at sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, or places of worship.
4.  **Accurate Information:** Is the camera's location and description accurate?
5.  **Image Quality:** Is the camera feed clear and stable?
6.  **No Inappropriate Content:** The camera feed should not contain any illegal, pornographic, or violent content.

## 🚨 Handling Reports and Flags

Users can report or flag public cameras that they believe violate our community guidelines. All reports will be reviewed by a moderator within 24 hours.

**Report Handling Procedure:**

1.  **Review the Report:** Read the user's report and examine the camera feed in question.
2.  **Assess the Violation:** Determine if the camera violates our community guidelines.
3.  **Take Action:**
    - **Clear Violation:** Immediately remove the camera from the public directory and notify the camera owner.
    - **Potential Violation:** Temporarily unlist the camera and contact the owner to request changes.
    - **No Violation:** Dismiss the report and, if possible, notify the reporter of the decision.
