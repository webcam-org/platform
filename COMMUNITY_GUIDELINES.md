## 📍 Location and Labeling

### Be Accurate and Honest

**Required:**
- Provide accurate GPS coordinates
- Write clear, truthful descriptions
- Label the type of camera correctly
- Disclose if camera is on private property requiring access permission

**Examples:**

✓ **GOOD:** "My front driveway, Lake City, FL - View of street and my property"

✗ **BAD:** "Famous Celebrity's House" (privacy violation)

✗ **BAD:** "Secret camera in locker room" (illegal)

✓ **GOOD:** "Downtown traffic cam, Main St & 5th Ave" (public benefit)

---

## 🔊 Audio Recording

### Special Considerations

If your camera records audio:
- **Know your state's laws** (some require two-party consent)
- **Post visible signage** if recording in public business areas
- **Disable audio for public streams** if legally uncertain
- **Never record private conversations** without all parties' consent

**Tip:** When in doubt, disable audio for public cameras. Video-only is safer legally.

---

## 👥 Privacy and Respect

### Respect Your Neighbors

**DO:**
- Point cameras at your own property
- Angle cameras to avoid neighbors' windows and yards
- Inform neighbors if your camera may incidentally capture their property
- Respond politely to privacy concerns

**DON'T:**
- Intentionally surveil neighbors
- Share cameras that make others uncomfortable
- Ignore reasonable privacy requests
- Use cameras for disputes or harassment

### Expectation of Privacy

Even in public spaces, respect reasonable expectations:
- Don't zoom into private areas
- Avoid focusing on individuals without cause
- Be thoughtful about vulnerable locations (women's shelters, domestic violence safe houses)

---

## 🚸 Children's Privacy

### Special Protections

**We prohibit:**
- Cameras with children as primary subjects
- School cameras (unless official school property with authorization)
- Playground cameras in residential areas
- Any camera used to surveil or exploit minors

**Exceptions:**
- Your own children in your own yard (still: don't share publicly)
- Public events where children are incidentally present (parades, fairs)
- Official educational/institutional cameras with proper authorization

**If children appear in frame incidentally** (passing by on sidewalk), that's generally acceptable if camera's purpose is legitimate (traffic, weather).

---

## 🏘️ Neighborhood Sharing

### Community Watch Done Right

**Purpose:**
- Deter package theft and property crime
- Monitor traffic and parking
- Share weather and local conditions
- Build community awareness

**Guidelines:**
- Only share outdoor common areas
- Get neighbor consent when possible
- Focus on community benefit, not surveillance
- Don't use for personal disputes or gossip

**Example:**

✓ **GOOD:** "Neighborhood entrance, shared with HOA approval for package theft prevention"

✗ **BAD:** "Watching my annoying neighbor's house 24/7"

---

## 🎥 Technical Requirements

### Camera Quality and Setup

**Required:**
- Camera must be reasonably stable (not constant shaking)

- Camera must be online consistently (>80% uptime preferred)
- Provide working stream (not 24/7 error screen)

**Recommended:**
