## The Problem Section

### Why webcam.org Exists

**Big Tech surveillance cameras have three problems:**

❌ **Ring & Nest share your footage with police** - without warrants, without asking
❌ **$10-20/month subscriptions** - forever, for features that should be free
❌ **Your data, their servers** - employees watching, hackers stealing, you have no control

**We built the alternative.**

## Solution Section (Two Paths)

### Path 1: For Camera Owners
# Take Back Control

Install our open-source software on a $35 Raspberry Pi or your home server:

✓ Works with any camera (USB, IP, RTSP, even old webcams)
✓ AI person detection (no cloud needed)
✓ Mobile app with instant alerts
✓ Store video locally or in your own cloud
✓ Optional: Share public cams with the community

**Free forever.** No subscriptions. You own the hardware. You own the data.

## FAQ Section

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes. The software is 100% free and open source. Optional paid tiers ($3-8/mo) add cloud backup and extra features, but the core is free forever.

**Q: Do I need to be technical?**
A: If you can install an app, you can do this. We have a one-command Docker installer. 95% of setup is automatic.

**Q: What cameras work?**
A: Anything. USB webcams, IP cameras, RTSP streams, even your old laptop camera. If it produces video, it works.

**Q: Can police access my cameras?**
A: Absolutely not. Your cameras, your server, your control. We never touch your video data.

**Q: What if I already use Frigate or MotionEye?**
A: Perfect! Just install our plugin. Keep using what you love, we just add the mobile app and public cam features.

**Q: What about bandwidth?**
A: Public cams use peer-to-peer WebRTC. Your video streams directly to viewers. We don't store or relay it (unless you want cloud backup).
